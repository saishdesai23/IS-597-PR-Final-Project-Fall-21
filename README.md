##What is fertility rate and how is it different from birth rate?
Fertility rate is defined as the total number of children women would hypothetically birth assuming survival which is what we are exploring.
Birth rate is defined as the total number of actual births within a specific time period.
Replacement fertility rate is defined as the minimum fertility rate necessary to maintain a nation’s population.

##The Issue of Decreasing Global Fertility Rates
Global fertility rates have been steadily decreasing since the late 1960s.
Specific countries have birth rates that are lower than the statistical replacement birth rate.
This can result in a country with a disproportionately large elderly population which can be difficult to sustain economically.

##Declining birth rate in Developed Countries: A radical policy re-think is required by G. Nargund
This was an article written in 2009 and addresses the issue of decreasing global birth rates. It also escribes factors that are potentially contributing to decreasing global fertility rates. However, data sources were not cited in the article and there were no details for analysis provided. Therefore, our goal was to determine if select statements made by the article are supported by data. The statements that we'll be exploring in our analysis can be broadly categorized into four factors that we believe play an important role in the trend of decreasing fertility rates: economic growth, decreasing child mortality, increasing child expenditure, and religiosity.
